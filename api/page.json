The franchise has failed to register a single win so far out of the five matches they have featured in. Their previous game saw them fail to post even 100 runs on the board, which was later chased down by the Paarl Royals with rather ease. They are in a dire need to pick up a win now.\n\n\nThe Joburg Super Kings, on the other hand, are the table toppers with an absolute domination on the points table. The Faf du Plessis-led side is yet to lose a single match this match, with 15 points to their tally after four matches. They already have a hat-trick of wins, but won't mind making it a double hat-trick and bolster their top spot on the table. High on confidence, the Super Kings will be eyeing to beat the hosts.",
